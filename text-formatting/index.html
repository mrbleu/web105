            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Valorant</strong> is a team-based futuristic first person shooter video game. Players play as agents, characters that come from all around the world. The main game consists of two groups of five assigned to either the attacking or defending team.<br> Agents all have unique abilities, as well as one ultimate move. Each player starts each round with one basic pistol and with one or more "signature ability" charge. Other weapons and abilities can be bought using money earned based on how much damage you have done.

            <h3>Is it fun?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I believe this game to be very fun and endlessly replayable. It's a blast to play with your friends, and it never gets old. You can watch yourself improve in real time, and it is highly competitive. <br>But don't take it from me, here's a quote from a video game journalist Austen Goslin from the publication <i>Polygon</i>:
            <q>it's one of the most fun tactical shooters I've played</q>
            </p>

            <h3>Updates</h3>
            <p>The developers <i>Riot Games</i> makes sure to keep the game interesting with updates to the game every month or so. Since it's launch on June 2nd, the game has been over 8 significant updates with the addition of two new agents and a lot of balance changes.<br> They plan on supporting the game for many more years to come, so the players will expect lots of new content to enjoy. </p>
